excerpt: 'The community built environment is the physical space to guide residents’ health behaviors. One of the key issues to promote the construction of healthy community is to understand the characteristics and resources of the community, and how the community built environment influences individual health. As a result, it is of great practical significance to develop reasonable method to assess features of built environment considered relevant to promote local community health. In recent years, the community built environment audit tools are often used in the research of public health field, focusing on the characteristics and quality of micro-scale built environment (e.g. sidewalks, outdoor benches). Moreover, the adoption of the tools can support more detailed environmental condition assessment, problem analysis and scenescape simulation. Through the relevant theoretical and empirical literature researches, this study interprets the connotation of community built environment audit tool, identifies its core value and essentials, and summarizes key characteristics of 15 audit tools widely used in the world. On this basis, a set of audit tool which is suitable for Chinese context and health-oriented community built environment is constructed to provide methodological support for promoting healthy community construction.'
