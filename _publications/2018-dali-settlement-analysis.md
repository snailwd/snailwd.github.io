This master's thesis examines the spatial organization and residential characteristics of traditional settlements in the Dali region of China. The research combines field surveys, spatial analysis, and architectural documentation to understand the relationship between settlement patterns and residential space organization in this historically and culturally significant area.

The study contributes to the understanding of traditional Chinese settlement morphology and provides insights for contemporary rural planning and heritage preservation efforts.
