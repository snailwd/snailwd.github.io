## 💡 About Me

I hold both B.Arch. and M.Arch. from Sichuan University, China.  

Currently pursuing PhD opportunities in Urban Informatics, my research interest focus on leveraging spatial analysis, interactive visualization, and computational methods to understand urban complexity and inform evidence-based policy decisions. With a background in architecture and data product management, I am passionate about translating large-scale urban data into actionable insights for sustainable and healthier cities.
