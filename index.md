## 💡 About Me

I hold both a B.Arch. and M.Arch. from Sichuan University, China, and have worked as a product manager for [AI-driven architectural design tools](https://snailwd.github.io/projects/pinlan/) and [urban big data platforms](https://snailwd.github.io/projects/xyx/). 

Currently I am exploring PhD opportunities in Urban Informatics, where my research focuses on using spatial analysis, interactive visualization, and computational techniques to unravel urban complexity and support evidence-based urban design. With a background in architecture and data product management, I am deeply interested in translating large-scale urban data into actionable insights to promote sustainable and healthier cities.
