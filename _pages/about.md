# About Me


I hold both B.Arch. and M.Arch. from Sichuan University, China. <br>

Currently pursuing PhD opportunities in Urban Informatics, my research interest focus on leveraging spatial analysis, interactive visualization, and computational methods to understand urban complexity and inform evidence-based policy decisions. With a background in architecture and data product management, I am passionate about translating large-scale urban data into actionable insights for sustainable and healthier cities.
