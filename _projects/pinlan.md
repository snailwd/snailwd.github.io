**Product Manager / Shanghai Pinlan Data Technology Co., Ltd.**

At **Pinlan**, a company focused on the independent R&D and industrial application of the **"AI + CAD"** core platform, I was responsible for managing the development of the **AI-powered construction drawing automation product module**. The company leverages AI, BIM, big data, and cloud-native technologies to enhance the design and construction process, empowering the digital transformation of key sectors such as **Architecture, Engineering, and Construction (AEC)** and **Manufacturing (MFG)**. 

Below are the key contributions I made during my time at Pinlan:

- **Owned the AI-powered construction drawing automation product module**  
  Defined the **MVP (Minimum Viable Product)** and iterated it through agile processes to complete the **PMF (Product-Market Fit)**.

- **Measured business value and defined product modules**  
  Conducted detailed analysis on product value and target customers, identifying critical product challenges. Defined clear acceptance criteria and scope for success.

- **Designed MVP and planned roadmap for AI-generated construction drawings**  
  Focused on delivering a **minimum viable module** instead of all-inclusive drawings for various disciplines. Worked with industry experts, customers, and R&D teams to define market opportunities and technical boundaries. Prioritized the product roadmap, delivering **20+ user stories** in areas like intelligent recognition, rule-based design, and platform interaction.

- **Managed product lifecycle**  
  Led product development and delivery by creating comprehensive product documentation and prototypes. Organized bi-weekly product iterations through daily stand-ups, sprint reviews, and retrospectives. Actively managed the sprint goals, product backlog, and feature launches to ensure alignment with stakeholders.

- **Followed up on product release**  
  Monitored **NPS indicators** and improved the modular drawing process based on user feedback. Enhanced UI/UX design for critical features, like adding pre-drawing verification to improve user experience and drive positive NPS results.

- **Supported go-to-market strategy**  
  Promoted the product to core users, which resulted in **12 primary accounts** with front-line design institutes and **100 designer sub-accounts** during the public beta phase.

- **Optimized internal cloud document product**  
  Prioritized feedback from architects, engineers, and MEP designers against limited development resources. Delivered iterative product versions and created user manuals and training sessions to ease onboarding.

This experience at Pinlan allowed me to leverage my skills in **AI-driven product management**, **cross-functional leadership**, and **market strategy** to contribute to the digital transformation in the AEC and MFG industries. My work helped streamline the intelligent design process, improving **collaboration, efficiency, and standardization** across engineering design.
