The 11th Street in Chengdu, near the 1st ring road, features a cluster of traditional Sichuan folk buildings surrounded by modern 4-6-storey structures. Originally a Taoist temple, it became a residential area in the early 20th century, now housing about 40 low-income families. Our survey focused on people and objects as key elements shaping this living space, using methods like video recording, observation, and interviews to explore the relationships among residents, objects, and the street itself.
